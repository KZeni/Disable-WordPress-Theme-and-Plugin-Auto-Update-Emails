Looking for WordPress core version update email notifications instead/as well? Try out [Disable WordPress Core Update Email](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-core-update-email/) as that tackles that specific group of emails in this same lightweight fashion (use official WordPress filters to simply disable the email[s] as described.) These two plugins can work together to remove all of these (hence why this doesn't also remove core update notifications), but one can use one or the other if a specific set of emails is desired to be blocked (ex. use this plugin if theme & plugin updates are too much while you want to know about a potentially major WordPress core update.)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What else needs to be done? Is there a settings screen to enable/configure it? =

No. This is a simple & lightweight plugin that simply uses the official filters made available as of WordPress 5.5 to disable these email notifications upon activation. Deactivating the plugin then has it resume default behavior. There's literally nothing else to it. A simple implementation that's quick & easy to utilize.
